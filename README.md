# blogAppVersion1

## Working

Extremely simple! Just read or write blogs!

## Limitations

### No Database
This app doesn't have a database, this is just a primitive version and can thus only store blogs while server is running (If it crashes, data goes  ðŸ’¥).

### Only runs on localhost
Once again, this is a very primitive version for my own learning. (If you can't tell I am learning how to write a README just now :P)

### Requires node.js

## How to run?

### Download the files
### Install the required node-modules by writing
``` npm install ```
### If you have nodemon installed
``` nodemon index.js ```
### If not
``` node index.js ```
